# SimpleChattyBot
Simple Chatty Bot project in Java.<br> 
From JetBrains Academy (hyperskill.org).<br>

**Learning outcomes**<br>
You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Java and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and methods.<br>

**About**<br>
Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, <br>
creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders <br>
to guide you through the basics of coding. <br>
During this journey, you will also play <br>
some word and number games that you are <br>
going to implement on your own. <br>
Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!<br>
